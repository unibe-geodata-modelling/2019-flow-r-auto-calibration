Readme Flow-R OptimizationRequirements:-ARCGIS with spatial analyst extension-Flow-R engine-Python with 2.7-interpreter-Digital elevation model (DEM)-Extent raster of past event (e.g. from ngkat)Preparations outside of python:-Cut DEM to size of the catchment, resample to 10m cell size-Cut extent raster of past event to catchment, resample to 10m cell size (same as above), values for cells should be 1 = within range of event, 0 = out of range-Create starting point raster with one (or more) cell of origin for a debris flow (same extent and cell size as above)-Save all files within the recommended folder-structure (see documentation), create additional folders for outputsPreparations within python:-Line 79: set working directory to individual folder address-Line 82ff.: if folders according to recommended folder-structure: do not change, otherwise: set directories to corresponding folders/files-Line 102: set date to today’s dateResults:-The program calculates the optimal input-parameters for Holmgren x and reach angle for the given event.-These values as well as the hit-false-ratio (hfr) reached with said values are printed at the end of the optimization process.-the hfr is an inverse value: values close to zero indicate a good result, values close to one indicate a bad match between model and actual event.-raster files are saved to the output folders "FlowR" and "hfr_steps". There are many folders, search for the ones with the date and the optimal holmgren x and reach angle values in their name.
-the file "dif_flowr_ngkat.tiff" shows the differences between the modeled extent and the actual event's extent.Re-run:-Before re-run, empty the output-folders or change the date (Line 102), as the program won’t work otherwise.
